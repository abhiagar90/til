# Some confidence hacks

1. Earth is a pale blue dot. Really! If it is a pale blue dot, then what are we?
OR
I ask myself, why do I even need confidence? 
I’m here on this planet for a split second. Just relax and enjoy this tiny vacation that the universe gave me.

2. Even the most famous people in the world are just people. They might be really cool or whatever, but they are just people. 
Nobody is any better or more special than you are. We are all just people. 

3. Successful people aren't the ones who are confident because they never screw up, they are confident 
because they know it doesn't matter what happens. They are going to win because they took action, not because of the outcome. 
Simply having the confidence to take action, and then taking action will put you in front of 90% of people 
who live in fear of making a mistake and don't have the confidence to take action.

4. You need to:
stand as straight as possible (this is not gonna be easy at first)
and SMIRK.
You need to practice a light smirk, that means 
“I am perfectly satisfied of myself, I am in a good mood, and, also, I know something that you don’t”.

5. Put on a smile. Smiles have great psychological benefits.

6. Practice Power Poses

7. Positive Self Talk - What you hear is what you will eventually believe. 
Tell yourself that the situation will go great and that you’re going to have fun.

8. Slow Down Everything. Walk slower, talk slower, react slower. Do everything a bit slower. 
You get two benefits from this. First, you’ll find that by slowing down, you’ll have more time to think through want you want to say or do.
That leads you to speaking and moving more deliberately, which makes you look more confident.

9. Work hard.
Unfortunately, this hack isn't easy, but it is definitely worthwhile. 
If you actually work hard and are knowledgeable/passionate in something, you definitely feel better about yourself.

10. Use Mantras
“I am confident, I am powerful, I am [enter your name].”
“Every day in every way, I’m getting stronger and stronger.”

11. More on positive Self talk. Remove negative ones.
Stand Guard Over Your Thoughts
Every day, we have an incessant stream of thoughts. Some good ones, and some bad ones. 
They key is to catch the bad ones, and replace them immediately with empowering ones.

12. Core Confidence
It’s the most powerful form of confidence because no one can ever take it away from you.
You can fail a test, yet still feel and act confident. “No problem. I’ll pass it next time.”
You can get rejected, yet still feel and act confident. “I dodged a bullet there. We weren’t a good fit at all.”
You can get fired, yet still feel and act confident: “This sucks, but now I finally have the time to pursue my bagpipe business.”

13. Do your homework; prepare as well you can!

14. Try, fail, adapt, try again. 
The people who have made all the mistakes and managed to learn from them are usually extremely confident. 
These folks know that every mistake is a learning opportunity from which they will profit in the long run.

15. The brain has “mirror neurons”. You watch something, and you learn. That’s how we adapt.
If I watch a youtube clip of someone displaying amazing confidence in a difficult situation then 
it’s like a shot of crack cocaine. For the next 2 to 10 hours I’ll mimic that confidence, whether I realize it or not.

16. I am more confident asking questions and learning than I am answering them.
Because of the math: there are more questions than answers in the world. 
I think Godel proved that. I think someone did. A math person.
So it’s easier to come up with questions.
ALSO
When you aks questions, you look confident!
